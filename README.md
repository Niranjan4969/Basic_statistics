In machine learning, descriptive statistics provide a snapshot of the dataset's main characteristics. Metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation offer insights into central tendencies and data dispersion, aiding in the initial exploration and understanding of the input features and target variables. These statistical measures help practitioners grasp the distribution and variability within the data, forming a basis for further analysis and model selection.
